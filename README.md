# CS-465-Full-Stack-1

##### For this application, we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js Express, MongoDB and Angular. We used HTML/CSS/JavaScript as the coding language and Node.js as the runtime environment. We used express framework to create an MVC for client side. And Angular.js to create an SPA for the admin side of the app.

##### We used MongoDB and NoSQL to store our data because of its schema less property allowing for a scalable and flexible program.
##### We stored data in a JSON format due to the benefits that it provides of easy data access.

##### To create reusability, we used partials for our html code, and separated the admin and client side into two section that include all its files in their own section.

##### I decided to test the data in Postman first to identify any issues. This made it easy to debug because if there was an error in the request, the problem would likely## be in the routing or wherever the request was being made. After verifying the requests worked correctly in Postman, I checked MongoDB Compass to see if the data existed correctly based on the request.

##### The course has made me understand the power of debugging and research. Due to the many elements of our guides being out of date, I had to refactor many parts through out which in turn gave me a better understanding of full stack development.
